# 4-Code-Quiz
For this assignment, I attempted to create a code quiz that, when began, would start a timer and ask the user a series of questions each with four possible answers. For each wrong answer, the user was to lose 20 seconds of the remaining time, and the scores of the user would be displayed at the end of the quiz, and whenever the "view high scores" button was pressed. I was successfully able to get the first stage of this to work, meaning that when the user presses the "Start Quiz" button, the description of the quiz disappears, the question is displayed as well as the answers, and the timer begins to count down. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it would appear that I had gotten everything right based off the first click alone if it weren't for the buttons all appearing on the same line, because none of the methods I had found for inserting line breaks seemed to work for me. The other major issue is that I couldn't seem to get any of the other buttons to work without the "Start Quiz" button to suddenly stop working each time I attempted to add more functions. I am not sure why that continued to happen, but it prevented me from being able to confidently make any further changes to the page as it only seemed to mess up what I already had worked on.
